# A web site created to evaluate the Pelican static site generator.

And accidental Pelican tutorial.

This repo was created as part of an evaluation of the Pelican static site generator. Normally this repo would be private, but I have extensively documented my experience and, since that document is publicly available, it made sense to make the repo available for public inspection. This repo, and the connected web site, is my sandbox. I will be here playing around with Pelican's features and capabilities. You are free to have a look around. Maybe we can all learn something together.

It was hosted on Netlify.com.
Now hosted on Github pages. It just made sense.

You can see the resulting web site at: [greeder59-eval-pelican](https://greeder59.github.io/eval-pelican/)

You can get Pelican [Here](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/)
