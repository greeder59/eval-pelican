    <p>Good Morning Gardeners, and Happy Easter. I was out earlier and noticed that the garden centers are now open. Bobz on TV Highway, one block east of 185th has opened but are not fully stocked. Fred Meyer has opened it's garden center but is also thinly stocked as well.Mostly I see that they are selling Strawberries and Tomatoes. And also lettuce. Apparently I goofed and didn't get my lettuce started soon enough.</p>
<p>Let's talk about strawberries.
There are over 100 varieties of strawberries. Each is bred for a different growing region.
To enjoy fresh, juicy strawberries from your own garden, begin by setting plants out as early as possible in the spring. Like right now. Spade the soil deeply and set the plants in double or triple rows. Strawberries also do well planted in containers.
Runners should be removed as well as the first flush of flowers so plants can direct energy into establishing a strong root system.</p>
<p>If you want to plant strawberries in hanging containers, you should look for ‘Quinault’ strawberries. It is a newer everbearing variety that produces berries on unrooted runners. Which means that the mother plant will send down runners. Daughter plants will form at the ends of those runners. Unlike most varieties, these unrooted daughter plants will produce fruit. It is a great tasting strawberry developed by Washington State University so is perfectly suited for this area. The fruit is so tasty. Berries up to 2″ in diameter from June till frost. Self-pollinating.</p>
<p>I hope I can inspire someone to get a 12 inch hanging basket, Some potting soil and single Quinault start. Now think of all the yummy goodness you will enjoy.</p>
