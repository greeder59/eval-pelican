Title: About me

## A web site created to evaluate the Pelican static site generator.
This web site was created as part of an evaluation of the Pelican static site generator and the Netlify web host. Along the way it became a Pelican tutorial. And now it has become a blog about my adventures with Pelican. This site, and the connected repo, is my sandbox. I will be here playing around with Pelican's features and capabilities. You are free to have a look around. Maybe we can all learn something together.

About those gardening articles: I wanted to show what happens when a site has more than one category.
