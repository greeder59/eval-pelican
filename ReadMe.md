# A web site created to evaluate the Pelican static site generator.
This repo was created to evaluate the Pelican static site generator and the Netlify web host. Normally this repo would be private, but I have extensivly documented my experience and, since the that document is (will be) publicly available, it made sense to make the repo available for public inspection.
