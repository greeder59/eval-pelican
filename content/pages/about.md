Title: About me

## A web site created to evaluate the Pelican static site generator.
This web site was created as part of an evaluation of the Pelican static site generator and the Netlify web host. This site, and the connected repo, is my sandbox. I will be here playing around with Pelican's features and capabilities. You are free to have a look around. Maybe we can all learn something together.

You can inspect the Github repository for this site [Here](https://github.com/greeder59/eval-pelican.git)


You can get Pelican [Here](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/)
