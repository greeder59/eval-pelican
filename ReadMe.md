# A web site created to evaluate the Pelican static site generator.
This repo was created as part of an evaluation of the Pelican static site generator and the Netlify web host. Normally this repo would be private, but I have extensivly documented my experience and, since that document is publicly available, it made sense to make the repo available for public inspection. This repo, and the connected web site, is my sandbox. I will be here playing around with Pelican's features and capabilities. You are free to have a look around. Maybe we can all learn something together.

You can see the resulting web site at: [greeder59-eval-pelican](https://greeder59-eval-pelican.netlify.com/)
